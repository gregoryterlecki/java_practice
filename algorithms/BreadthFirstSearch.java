/*
  BREADTH FIRST SEARCH

  What is it?
  Depth first search is an algorithm for traversing tree or graph type data
  structures.

  psuedocode:
  BFS(Graph G, node start_node){
    let Q be a new Queue
    label start_node as discovered
    Q.enqueue(start_node)
    while(!Q.isEmpty){
      node v = Q.dequeue
      if(v is the target){
        return v
      }
      for all edges (v, w) adjacent to v
        
    }
  }
