/*
  COMMAND

  What is it?
  A command is an encapsulated set of code that can be executed at a later time,
  or any time. Commands are also often designed to be undone if needed.

  The encapsulated hidden object (being the command), would typically have a
  method in it called execute that another part of the application or program
  code would invoke at a given time that would trigger all the actions listed.

  The invoker transfers this command to another object called the receiver. The
  receiver is the actual object that has the code to be execute, when commanded
  by the invoker.

  Again I'll have to finish this later when I have time and understand the
  command design pattern better.
